// Enable (1) or disable (0) checksum verification within the
// twi.c module.  When enabled the TWI_CMD_CHECKED_TXN command
// is enabled and basic checksum validation of reads and writes
// of registers can be made for more robust communication with
// the OpenServo.  The checksum code consumes about 280 bytes
// of Flash code space when enabled.
#define TWI_CHECKED_ENABLED         1

// Enable (1) or disable (0) cubic Hermite curve following motion
// functions.  These functions allow the OpenServo to be controlled
// by keypoints along a cubic Hermite curve with each keypoint
// indicating servo position and velocity at a particular time.
#define CURVE_MOTION_ENABLED        1

// Enable (1) or disable (0) some test motion code within the
// main.c module.  This test code can be enabled to test basic
// positioning of the OpenServo without a TWI master controlling
// the OpenServo.  It should normally be disabled.
#define MAIN_MOTION_TEST_ENABLED    0

// Enable (1) or disable (0) standard servo pulse control signaling
// of the seek position.  As of 2/2/07 this feature is still under
// active development.  Please visit the OpenServo forums for the
// current status of this feature.
#define PULSE_CONTROL_ENABLED       0

// Enable (1) or disable (0) the swapping of PWM output A and B.
// This swapping must sometimes enabled depending on whether the
// positive lead to the motor is attached to MOSFET/PWM output A
// or MOSFET/PWM output B.  This option makes this easy to control
// within software.
#define SWAP_PWM_DIRECTION_ENABLED  0

// Enable (1) or disable (0) the rolling subtype. The subtype will
// change string on each read
#define ROLLING_SUBTYPE             1

// Enable (1) or disable (0) the back EMF speed measurement module
// Enabling this function introduces an off period of the PWM
// output which means you will need to recalibrate the PID and PWM
// module variables.
